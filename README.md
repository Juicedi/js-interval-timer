# Interval workout timer

This is just something I wanted to create. This is not meant to be anything
too serious. This webapp doesn't need any servers to run correctly. Opening the
index.html will work just fine.

## How to install development environment

Run normal npm install command. This has been tested with:

 - node v10.22.0
 - npm v6.14.6

#### Note
The img directory is missing from this repository. So if you want to add
a background image to the index html, you should add img/background.jpg to the
project root.
